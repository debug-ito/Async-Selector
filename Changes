Revision history for Async-Selector

1.01    2012/12/24
        select(), select_lt(), select_et(), selections(), cancel() methods
        are now deprecated (but can be used to maintain compatibility).
        They are replaced by watch API now. See "COMPATIBILITY" for details.

        Bug fix: a selection callback did not fire when triggered if its
        condition input was undef. 


0.02    2012/07/29
        Modify the behavior of select() method with no resource selection.
        Before: It accepts the (no) selection without warning.
        After : It ignores (rejects) the selection without warning.

        Because a selection without selected resource will never be
        removed except that the user explicitly cancel() it, it easily
        causes memory leak. To avoid this danger, selection with no resource
        is explicitly rejected. In this case, select() returns undef.

Revision history for Async-Selector

0.02    2012/07/29
        Modify the behavior of select() method with no resource selection.
        Before: It accepts the (no) selection without warning.
        After : It ignores (rejects) the selection without warning.

        Because a selection without selected resource will never be
        removed except that the user explicitly cancel() it, it easily
        causes memory leak. To avoid this danger, selection with no resource
        is explicitly rejected. In this case, select() returns undef.
